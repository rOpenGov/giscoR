[giscoR](https://dieghernan.github.io/giscoR/) is a API package that helps to
retrieve data from [Eurostat - GISCO (the Geographic Information System of the
COmmission)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco). It also provides some
lightweight data sets ready to use without downloading. Currently only the
[Administrative Units / Statistical
Units](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units)
data sets are supported.

GISCO [(FAQ)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/faq) is a geospatial open
data repository including several data sets as countries, coastal lines, labels
or [NUTS levels](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/regions-and-cities/overview).
The data sets are usually provided at several resolution levels
(60M/20M/10M/03M/01M) and in 3 different projections (4326/3035/3857).

Note that the package does not provide metadata on the downloaded files, the
information is available on the [API
webpage](https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/).

## Installation

Install `giscoR` from [**CRAN**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=giscoR):

``` r
install.packages("giscoR")
```

You can install the developing version of `giscoR` with:

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("dieghernan/giscoR")
```

## Usage

This script highlights some features of `giscoR`:

```{r example}

library(giscoR)
library(sf)

 # Different resolutions
 DNK_res60 <- gisco_get_countries(resolution = '60', country = 'DNK')
 DNK_res20 <-
   gisco_get_countries(resolution = '20', country = 'DNK')
 DNK_res10 <-
   gisco_get_countries(resolution = '10', country = 'DNK')
 DNK_res03 <-
   gisco_get_countries(resolution = '03', country = 'DNK')
 
 
 # Plot tmap
 
 library(tmap)
 
 plot60 <- qtm(DNK_res60, fill = "tomato", main.title = "60M")
 plot20 <- qtm(DNK_res20, fill = "tomato", main.title = "20M")
 plot10 <- qtm(DNK_res10, fill = "tomato", main.title = "10M")
 plot03 <- qtm(DNK_res03, fill = "tomato", main.title = "03M")
 
 tmap_arrange(plot60, plot20, plot10, plot03)

 # Labels and Lines available
 
 labs <- gisco_get_countries(spatialtype = "LB", 
                             region = "Africa", 
                             epsg = "3857")
 
 coast <- gisco_get_countries(spatialtype = "COASTL", 
                              epsg = "3857")
 
 
tm_shape(coast, bbox = labs) +
  tm_lines("deepskyblue4") +
  tm_shape(labs) +
  tm_dots(
    col = "springgreen4",
    border.col = "darkgoldenrod1",
    shape = 21,
    border.lwd = 1,
    size = 1
  )

```

## Thematic maps

An example of a thematic map plotted with the `cartography` package. The
information is extracted via the `eurostat` package:

```{r thematic}

nuts3 <- gisco_get_nuts(
  year = "2016",
  epsg = "3035",
  resolution = "3",
  nuts_level = "3"
)

# Countries
countries <-
  gisco_get_countries(year = "2016",
                      epsg = "3035",
                      resolution = "3")

# Use eurostat
library(eurostat)

popdens <- get_eurostat("demo_r_d3dens")
popdens <- popdens[popdens$time == "2018-01-01", ]



nuts3.sf <- merge(nuts3,
                  popdens,
                  by.x = "NUTS_ID",
                  by.y = "geo",
                  all.x = TRUE)

br <- c(0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 30000)

# Plot
tm_shape(countries, bbox = c(23, 14, 73, 54) * 10e4) +
  tm_fill("#E0E0E0") +
  tm_shape(nuts3.sf) +
  tm_fill(
    "values",
    breaks = br,
    palette = "-inferno",
    alpha = .7,
    title = "Population density (km2)\nNUTS3 (2018)"
  ) +
  tm_shape(countries) +
  tm_borders(lwd = .25) +
  tm_credits(gisco_attributions(),
             position = c("left", "bottom"))  +
  tm_layout(
    bg.color = "#daf3ff",
    outer.bg.color = "white",
    legend.bg.color = "white",
    legend.frame = "black",
    legend.title.size = 0.8,
    inner.margins = c(0, 0, 0, 0),
    outer.margins = c(0, 0, 0, 0),
    frame = TRUE,
    frame.lwd = 0,
    attr.outside = TRUE
  )

```

### A note on caching

Some data sets (as Local Administrative Units - LAU, or high-resolution files)
may have a size larger than 50MB. You can use `giscoR` to create your own local
repository at a given local directory passing the following option:

``` r
options(gisco_cache_dir = "./path/to/location")
```

When this option is set, `giscoR` would look for the cached file and it will
load it, speeding up the process.

You can also download manually the files (`.geojson` format) and store them on
your local directory.

## Recommended packages

### API data packages

-   `eurostat` package (<https://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/>). This is an API
    package that provides access to open data from Eurostat.

### Plotting `sf` objects

Some packages recommended for visualization are:

-   [`tmap`](https://mtennekes.github.io/tmap/)
-   [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) +
    [`ggspatial`](https://github.com/paleolimbot/ggspatial)
