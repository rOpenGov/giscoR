Exceptions
==========

- The permission granted above does not extend to any material whose copyright
  is identified as belonging to a third-party, such as photos or illustrations
  from copyright holders other than the European Union. In these circumstances,
  authorisation must be obtained from the relevant copyright holder(s).

- Logos and trademarks are excluded from the above mentioned general permission,
  except if they are redistributed as an integral part of a Eurostat publication
  and if the publication is redistributed unchanged.

- When reuse involves translations of publications or modifications to the data
  or text, this must be stated clearly to the end user of the information. A
  disclaimer regarding the non-responsibility of Eurostat shall be included.

- When reuse involves translations of publications, the following copyright
  information and disclaimer shall be added:

  First published in English (or other language) as ‘Title of the publication’

  by Eurostat on the European Union's official website 'Europa'
  (c) European Union, year
  Translator: XXXXX

  Xxxx (Language of the translation) translation: (c) copyrightholder  (translator), year of the translation
  The translation is the sole responsibility of the author or authors of the
  translation.  In the event of any discrepancy between the original work and
  the translation, only the text of original work shall be considered valid.

- The following Eurostat data and documents may not be reused for commercial
  purposes, but non-commercial reuse is possible without restriction:

  - Data identified as belonging to sources other than Eurostat. All data
    published on Eurostat's website can be regarded as belonging to Eurostat
    for the purpose of their reuse, with the exceptions stated below, or if it
    is explicitly stated otherwise.

  - Publications or documents where the copyright belongs partly or fully to
    other organisations, for example concerning co-publications between Eurostat
    and other publishers.

  - Data for countries other than:
    - Member States of the European Union (EU)
    - Member States of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) official EU
      acceding and candidate countries.

    Examples are data for the United States of America, Japan or China. In such
    cases, the user will need to eliminate these data from the tables before
    reusing them commercially.

  - Trade data originating from Liechtenstein and Switzerland (as declaring
    countries), from 1995 onwards, and concerning the following commodity
    classifications: HS, SITC, BEC, NSTR and national commodity classifications.
    Thus it is, for example, not allowed to sell export/import data declared by
    Switzerland (concerning the above named commodity classifications). However,
    it is allowed to sell Swiss export / import data declared by an EU Member
    State (but see below a similar exception for Austria).

  - Trade data originating from Austria (as a declaring country) for a level of
    detail of the Combined Nomenclature of 8 digits; again, it is not allowed
    to sell export/import declared by Austria (concerning the above named
    commodity classifications), but it is allowed to sell Austrian export /
    import data declared by another EU Member State.
