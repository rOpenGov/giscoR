GENERAL COPYRIGHT

(c) European Union, 1995 - today

Eurostat has a policy of encouraging free re-use of its data, both for
non-commercial and commercial purposes. All statistical data, metadata, content
of web pages or other dissemination tools, official publications and other
documents published on its website, with the exceptions listed below, can be
reused without any payment or written licence provided that:

  - the source is indicated as Eurostat;
  - when re-use involves modifications to the data or text, this must be stated
  clearly to the end user of the information.


Exceptions

  1. The permission granted above does not extend to any material whose
  copyright is identified as belonging to a third-party, such as photos or
  illustrations from copyright holders other than the European Union. In these
  circumstances, authorisation must be obtained from the relevant copyright
  holder(s).

  2. Logos and trademarks are excluded from the above mentioned general
  permission, except if they are redistributed as an integral part of a
  Eurostat publication and if the publication is redistributed unchanged.

  3. When reuse involves translations of publications or modifications to the
  data or text, this must be stated clearly to the end user of the information.
  A disclaimer regarding the non-responsibility of Eurostat shall be included.

  4. The following Eurostat data and documents may not be reused for commercial
  purposes (but non-commercial reuse is possible without restriction):

    a. Data identified as belonging to sources other than Eurostat; all data
    published on Eurostat's website can be regarded as belonging to Eurostat
    for the purpose of their reuse, with the exceptions stated below, or if it
    is explicitly stated otherwise.

    b. Publications or documents where the copyright belongs partly or wholly
    to other organisations, for example concerning co-publications between
    Eurostat and other publishers.

    c. Data on countries other than
      - Member States of the European Union (EU), and
      - Member States of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and
      - official EU acceding and candidate countries.

    Examples are data on the United States of America, Japan or China. Often,
    such data are included in Eurostat data tables. In such cases, a re-user
    would need to eliminate such data from the tables before reusing them
    commercially.

    d. Trade data originating from Liechtenstein and Switzerland (as declaring
    countries), from 1995 onwards, and concerning the following commodity
    classifications: HS, SITC, BEC, NSTR and national commodity classifications.
    Thus it is, for example, not allowed to sell export/import data declared by
    Switzerland (concerning the above named commodity classifications). However,
    it is allowed to sell Swiss export/import data declared by an EU Member
    State (but see below a similar exception for Austria).

    e. Trade data originating from Austria (as a declaring country) for a level
    of detail of the Combined Nomenclature of 8 digits; again, it is not
    allowed to sell export/import declared by Austria (concerning the above
    named commodity classifications), but it is allowed to sell Austrian
    export/import data declared by another EU Member State.
