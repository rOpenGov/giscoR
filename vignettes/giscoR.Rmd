# Introduction

*Full site with more examples and vignettes on
<https://ropengov.github.io/giscoR/>*

[**giscoR**](https://ropengov.github.io/giscoR/) is a package designed to
provide a clean interaction with the [GISCO
API](https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/).

Within Eurostat, GISCO is responsible for meeting the European Commission's
geographical information needs at 3 levels: the European Union, its member
countries, and its regions. GISCO also provides a variety of shapefiles on
different formats, focusing specially in the European Union area, but providing
also some worldwide shapefiles, as country polygons, labels or borders and
coastal lines.

GISCO provides data on different resolutions suitable for representing small
areas (01M, 03M) as well as lightweight datasets specially useful for
representing wider areas (10M, 20M, 60M). Shapefiles are provided on 3 different
projections: EPSG 4326, 3035 or 3857.

**giscoR** returns [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html)
class objects, see <https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/>.

# Caching

**giscoR** provides a dataset caching capability, that could be set as:


``` r
gisco_set_cache_dir("./path/to/location")
```

If the file is not available locally, it would be downloaded to that directory
so the next time you need the corresponding data it would be loaded from the
local directory.

If you experience any problems on downloading, you can also manually download
the file from the [GISCO API
website](https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/) and store it on
your local directory.

# Downloading data

Please be aware that downloading provisions apply when using GISCO data:

> When data downloaded from this page is used in any printed or electronic
> publication, in addition to any other provisions applicable to the whole
> Eurostat website, data source will have to be acknowledged in the legend of
> the map and in the introductory page of the publication with the following
> copyright notice:
>
> -   EN: © EuroGeographics for the administrative boundaries
> -   FR: © EuroGeographics pour les limites administratives
> -   DE: © EuroGeographics bezüglich der Verwaltungsgrenzen
>
> For publications in languages other than English, French or German, the
> translation of the copyright notice in the language of the publication shall
> be used.
>
> If you intend to use the data commercially, please contact **EuroGeographics**
> for information regarding their licence agreements.

There is a function, `gisco_attributions()` that would guide you on this topic.
It also provides attributions on several languages.


``` r
library(giscoR)
gisco_attributions(lang = "en")
#> [1] "© EuroGeographics for the administrative boundaries"
```

``` r
gisco_attributions(lang = "fr")
#> [1] "© EuroGeographics pour les limites administratives"
```

``` r
gisco_attributions(lang = "de")
#> [1] "© EuroGeographics bezuglich der Verwaltungsgrenzen"
```

# Basic example

Some examples on data downloads


``` r
library(sf)
library(ggplot2) # Use ggplot for plotting

asia <- gisco_get_countries(region = "Asia")

ggplot(asia) +
  geom_sf(fill = "cornsilk", color = "#887e6a") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fffff3"),
    panel.border = element_rect(colour = "#887e6a", fill = NA, linewidth = 1.5),
    axis.text = element_text(
      family = "serif", colour = "#887e6a",
      face = "bold"
    )
  )
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="./country-1.png" alt="Political map of Asia" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">Political map of Asia</p>
</div>

You can select specific countries by name (in any language), ISO 3 codes or
Eurostat codes. The only restriction is that you can't mix country names, ISO3
and Eurostat codes on one single call.

It is possible also to combine different shapefiles, just set `resolution` and
`epsg` (and optionally `year`) to the same value:


``` r
africa_north <- gisco_get_countries(
  country = c(
    "Morocco", "Argelia", "Libia",
    "Tunisia", "Egypt"
  ),
  resolution = "20", epsg = "4326", year = "2016"
)

# Coastal lines

coast <- gisco_get_coastallines(resolution = "20", epsg = "4326", year = "2016")

# Plot
ggplot(coast) +
  geom_sf(color = "grey80") +
  geom_sf(data = africa_north, fill = "grey30", color = "white") +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-13, 37), ylim = c(18.5, 40)) +
  facet_wrap(vars(NAME_ENGL), ncol = 2)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="./africa-1.png" alt="Political map of North Africa" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">Political map of North Africa</p>
</div>

# Thematic maps with **giscoR**

This is an example on how **giscoR** can play nicely with some Eurostat data.
For plotting purposes we would use the
[**ggplot2**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) package however any
package that handles `sf` objects (e.g.
[**tmap**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tmap),
[**mapsf**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mapsf),
[**leaflet**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=leaflet), etc. could be used).

Also [**colorspace**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colorspace) and
[**rcartocolor**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rcartocolor) packages are
recommended, as they provide great color palettes.


``` r
# EU members
library(dplyr)
library(eurostat)

nuts2 <- gisco_get_nuts(
  year = "2021", epsg = "3035", resolution = "3",
  nuts_level = "2"
)
# Borders from countries
borders <- gisco_get_countries(epsg = "3035", year = "2020", resolution = "3")

eu_bord <- borders %>%
  filter(CNTR_ID %in% nuts2$CNTR_CODE)

# Eurostat data - Disposable income
pps <- get_eurostat("tgs00026") %>%
  filter(TIME_PERIOD == "2021-01-01")

nuts2_sf <- nuts2 %>%
  left_join(pps, by = "geo") %>%
  mutate(
    values_th = values / 1000,
    categ = cut(values_th, c(0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, Inf))
  )


# Adjust the labels
labs <- levels(nuts2_sf$categ)
labs[1] <- "< 15"
labs[6] <- "> 120"
levels(nuts2_sf$categ) <- labs


# Finally the plot
ggplot(nuts2_sf) +
